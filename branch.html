           <h1> Branching Statements:</h1><hr>
           <h5>Branching statements in programming are used to alter the flow of control in a program. They enable you to transfer control to a different part of the code based on certain conditions. Common branching statements include:

1. *Break:* Used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely.

2. *Continue:* Skips the rest of the loop's code and proceeds to the next iteration.

3. *Return:* Exits a function and returns a value (if applicable) to the calling code.

These statements allow programmers to create more flexible and dynamic code structures by influencing the program's execution based on specific conditions or requirements.</h5><hr>

<hr><h2>1.Simple if</h2><hr>
<p>A "simple if" is a basic conditional statement in programming that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. </p><hr>
<h3> Syntax :</h3><hr>
if(condition)<br>
    {
                              <br>Statement;
                              <br>}<br><hr>
                             <h2>2.If else</h2><hr>      
                           <p> An "if-else" statement is a programming construct that allows for two possible outcomes based on a specified condition. If the condition is true, one block of code is executed; otherwise, another block of code is executed.</p><hr>
 <h3> Syntax :</h3><hr>
if(condition)<br>
    {<br>
   Statement;<br>
    }<br>
   else<br>
   {<br>
   statement;<br>
   }<hr>
   <h2>3.If else if </h2><hr>
   <p>An "if-else if" statement, also known as a "switch" or "elseif" statement in some programming languages, is an extension of the basic "if-else" construct. It allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially, and the code associated with the first true condition is executed. If none of the conditions is true, an optional "else" block can be executed.</p><hr>
   <h3> Syntax :</h3><hr>
if(condition)<br>
   {<br>
   Statement;<br>
   }<br>
   else if (condition)<br>
   {<br>
   statement;<br>
   }<br>
   else<br>
   {<br>
   statement;<br>
  }<hr>
   
   <h2>4.Nested if </h2><hr>
   <p>A "nested if" statement is a programming structure where an additional "if" statement is placed inside the block of code executed by another "if" statement. This allows for more complex conditional branching, as the inner "if" statement is evaluated only if the outer "if" statement's condition is true.</p><hr>
   <h3>Syntax: </h3><hr>
   if (condition1) <br>{

   <br> // Statements to execute if condition1 is true<br>
    if (condition2) <br>{<br>

        // Statements to execute if condition1 and condition2 are both true<br>

    } <br>else <br>{<br>

        // Statements to execute if condition1 is true and condition2 is false<br>

    }<br>

 

} <br>else <br>{<br>

    // Statements to execute if condition1 is false<br>

}<hr>
<h3>5.Switch</h3><hr>
<p>A "switch" statement is a programming control structure that allows a variable or expression to be tested against multiple values. Depending on the value matching one of the specified cases, a corresponding block of code is executed. The switch statement provides an alternative to a series of "if-else if" statements, making the code more concise and readable.</p><hr>
