            <p>Computer languages can be classified into 2types:<br><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/computer/images/what-is-machine-language.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" align="right">
           a).Low level language<br>
           b).High level language</p>
           
            <p>Low level language are again sub-divided into two categories:<br>
            i.Machine language<br>
           ii.Assembly language</p>
           <h4>Machine language:</h4>
           <p>->The only language which the computer itself can understand is the machine language.<br>->We can use different language to program a computer.<br>->However,each computer program written in other computer languages is translated to machine language because running that program.<br>->If we write a program in assembly or a high level language,extimately,it is the machine language that instruct the computer.Thus, machine language is the fundamental language of the computer.<br>->A machine language is the set of instructions which are coded as a series of 1s and 0s and these instructions are directly understand by the computer without the help of a translating program.<br>->A program written in the form of 0's and 1's is called a machine language program.<br>->Each type of computer has its own machine language.<br>->That is the machine language is machine dependent and the machine language is different from one type of computer to another.</p>
